    <!-- A few sentences about a trip -->
    <p>This summer, I took my first trip to Disney World in Orlando. Stepping into the park I felt like entering a world of magic and my childhood nostalgia. It made me feel like a kid again.</p>

    My favorite food is Zereshk Polo. In English, it can be translated as Barberry Rice with chicken. I like it to be served with Shirazi salad. 
    This dish is my favorite Persian food and is often served during gatherings. The tangy taste of barberries mixed with the saffron rice 
    creates an unforgettable flavor. The chicken is tender and perfectly seasoned with saffron to complement the dish. It reminds me of my childhood.
